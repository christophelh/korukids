> Objectives 🌟
- Improve revenue by improving the matching rate between nannies and parents.
- Collect qualitative datas to understand nannies' mindset.

---

> Brainstorming phase 🧐

- **Ideal nannies:** Highly motivated (actively searching, sent high volume of emails, good availbilities , high number of families around)
- **Less ideal nannies:** Not active in the last 60 days, sent a low amount of emails, have low availabilities. 
- **Nannies who need a push:** Low amount of emails sent, active in the last 60 days,good amount of parents around. 
- **Questions** Why nannies who sent high volume & have a high number of parents around didnt get matched yet ????

> Segments 

---

> Higher Chance to be Matched **(Quick Win)**  👍🏽 ... 

- Been active the last 60 days. 
- Sent high number of  emails *(Avg 8)*. 
- Strong Open Rate 
- Have a good number of parents near them *(Avg 40)*.
- **Data Size** 47/201 =>  23% ( Acceptable sample size)


--- 

> Less Ideal nannies   ... 👎🏼

- Nannies who sent a low volume of emails.
- Nannies who haven't been online within 60 days. 
- High number of parents around.
- **Data Size** 26/201 =>  12% ( Small sample)

---

> Nannies who need a push 🦸🏼‍♀️

- Nannies who sent a low volume of emails.
- High number of families around them.
- Have been online in the last 60 days.
- **Data Size** 33/201 =>  16% (Small sample)

---

> I choose ***segment*** A because of 

- Sample size
- Higly motivated nannies
- In Market nannies
- But need a small qualitative investigation before running experiments (Why haven't them been matched yet)

---

## Experimentation Hypothesis 🧪

If we help nannies from **segment A** to connect with the right family we will increase our matching rate
--- 

> Tactics 

- Encourage them to browse and contact more families.
- Increase the raduis to show them more families around.
- Review quality of their profiles.
- Make nannies spend more times on the site.
- Contact them by phone.

---

> Channels & Assets

- Email 
- Retargeting Paid Social.
- Retargeting Search. 
- Landing page (Include tips, show other nannies that have been matched). 
  
--- 

> Focus on Email

- Increase emails frequency.
- Showcase the number of families currently searching.
- Give more personalised tips to improve their profile.
- Send emails to families with nannies profile from segment A.
- Encourage contacts on both side.
- Social Proof !!

---

> Metrics to measure (While running A/B test)

- Number of families contacted
- Number of profiles modified 
- Number of browsed families per nanny
- Number of contact established per nannies and families
- Clicks on retargeting Ads, CTR, time on site , ROAS 

---

> Tools to analyze results 

- Hotjar (Qualitative behaviour).
- Optimizely & Google Experiments to conduct Email and Landing page experiment (A/B Test).
- Visits, contacts, on-site nannies activities logs.
- Volume of Emails, opening rate.
- Gatsy to create high volume of landing pages.

## If success write playbook 📒 then move to other experiments


---

> Possible experimentations with other segments

- Send notification via other channels when an email is received would increase open rate then encourage nannies to interact with more families 
- Increase the radius for nannies who have low amount of parents near them will increase matching rate 
- Reactivate nannies who haven't been online in the past 60 days will help to increase the amount of matches. 
- Send a survey to nannies who havent been matched will help us to understand why ?
