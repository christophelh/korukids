## Objectives 🌟
- Improve revenue by improving the matching rate between nannies and parents
- Gather qualitative data to understand nannies mindset

---

>Brainstorming phase 🧐
What segment has the highest potential to improve nannies matching ?


---

> Higher Chance to be Matched, Nannies who have ... 

**(Segment A)**  👍🏽

-  Been active the last 60 days. 
- Sent emails *(Avg 8)*. 
- Have high numbers of parents near them *(Avg X)*.
- **Data Size**  => 28/201  => 14%.


--- 

> Lower Chance to be matched  
**(Segment B)** 👎🏼

- Nannies who send more than 8 emails but never got matched
- With high availabilities the last 45 days 
- But are still not matched to a family.
- People who were last online for more than 60 days 

---

## Experimentation Hypothesis 🧪

If we encourage nannies from **segment A** to contact more families we will increase our matching rate. 

--- 

> Measurements  in the **next 14 days**

- KR1 : Number of email sent in the  by the target nannies Vs **Before**  
- KR2 : Avg Open Rate will go up.
- KR3 : Matching rate will go up

---

> Channels 

- Email 
- Paid Social
- Target Text Ads

--- 

> Assets 

- Landing page with a list of family near them, 
- Banners with pictures of happy families with nannies
- Text Ads - Values ( Number of families , potential salary)
